# Lamb

A young, lightweight HTML and CSS template who aspires to attain the elegance of Mama (Ewe) and the bold, majestic structure of Papa (Ram).

Both Mama and Papa are worried about Lamb, as the days've gotten shorter and the weather colder. Mama's working on some coats for Lamb while Papa is toughening him up.

## Metaphor Extension
* Mama deals with Lamb's style, particularly his CSS.
	* Her 'coats' are to be thought of as themes.
		* *Do lambs actually wear coats?* [Yes they do](http://goodshepherdlambcoats.com/lambcoats/lambcoats.htm)!
* Papa deals with Lamb's structural integrity.
